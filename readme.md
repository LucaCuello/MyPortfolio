# Portfolio

## About

This website was built using React and TypeScript to showcase my projects as a front-end developer. I aimed to create a modern and accessible experience for all users. Here you will find a selection of my projects, including information about the technologies and methods used to create them. I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and learning more about my skills and experience. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out.
